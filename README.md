## Problem Statement

There is a popular mobile game in which cars are parked in a large parking and a particular car wants to leave
The cars can move along their lengths only. Certain squares are invalid
The goal of the game is to decide whether a solution exists for a particular given car(whether it can leave the car park successfully)
We model it as a Boolean Satisfiability Problem and use a SAT solver to solve the same
